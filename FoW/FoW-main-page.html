<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>From the beginning of our journey into flexible work, we have said that we would adjust and evolve our model. The new Treasury Board Secretariat (TSB) direction on the implementation of a common hybrid model within the federal public service means we will need to adjust our own approach to flexible work.</p>
<p>I know that you have many questions about how this affects you. To respond to initial questions from employees, here is a list of <a href="/en/department/sadm/tina-namiesniowski/tbs_direction_qs_as.shtml">Questions and Answers</a> which will be updated as we determine how <abbr>ESDC</abbr> will implement the government-wide direction. Additional background information on the TBS directed approach to hybrid work can be found on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/staffing/common-hybrid-work-model-federal-public-service.html">Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat</a> website.</p>
<p>Please be assured that we will continue to share information on the way forward as it becomes available.</p>
<p>We know that we can count on all of you to help implement this direction at <abbr>ESDC</abbr>. Additional information on how we will do that will be shared as early as possible in the New Year.</p>
<!-- p>On September 6, 2022, <abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr> began implementing its flexible work model to support our ability to fully deliver our mandate, provide exceptional service to Canadians, and to better support our employees, the Department and the Canadians we serve.</p>
<p>Just like the Clerk of the Privy Council said in her 29th Annual Report to the Prime Minister on the Public Service of Canada, I too am &ldquo;excited by the opportunity and obligation we have to chart a path forward that prepares the Public Service to deliver through whatever changes come next.&rdquo; <abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr>&rsquo;s flexible work model is based on an approach that capitalizes on the best of the in-office and remote work experiences to deliver exceptional results for Canadians. It acknowledges the importance of building culture, growing exceptional public servants and ensuring that our organization continues to be a leading employer.</p>
<p>Together with you &mdash; our more than 41,000&nbsp;employees across the country &mdash; we have worked extremely hard to get to this point and now it&rsquo;s time to lean in and move forward. The future of work is now.</p>
<p>As we implement our model, we will see more people in office relative to what we saw during the pandemic. Coming together in person is essential for the success of certain functions (for example, policy work), building effective teams, growing exceptional public servants and connecting individuals to our organization and culture. How we do this will involve some trial and error which means it will be important to learn, iterate and share experiences through open communication and feedback.</p>
<p>This is an incredible opportunity for lasting transformative change not only in our service to Canadians, but also in how we envision being part of the public service of the future. I hope you will join me in seizing this moment and embrace the many facets of our new flexible work model.</p>
<p>Along with the Future of Work Secretariat and all my colleagues who continue to work closely with us, I look forward to your continued collaboration as we implement our new way of working. Welcome to <abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr>&rsquo;s flexible work environment and I look forward to helping make &ldquo;flexible work for all of you.&rdquo;</p --> <!--
<p>The Flexible Work Environment re-imagined our workplace in a way that provides flexibility to employees while allowing us to deliver on our mandate and continue to provide exceptional service to Canadians.</p>
<p>Implementing our new flexible work model will require changes to how we operate and how we <a href="/en/department/sadm/future-work-esdc/leadership-norms-playbook.shtml">lead</a>. As a result, we commit to being intentional and transparent as we transition to a more fluid and agile organization. The experience of the last couple of years taught us some important lessons and revealed surprising new opportunities. Many of us have learned to embrace the flexibility that comes with working from home, but there have also been some downsides. We want to learn from these experiences to maximize the benefits of the Flexible Work Environment, starting now.</p>
<p>We understand that there is a lot of information for people to digest right now, and that some of the language being used on the subject of the future of work is new to many of us. For this reason, we have come up with &lsquo;<a href="/en/department/sadm/future-work-esdc/glossary.shtml">The Future of Work Glossary</a>&rsquo;, which lists commonly used words and phrases along with their corresponding definitions. If you have not already seen it, it&rsquo;s an excellent reference tool that I encourage everyone to have a look at. I hope that you find this site informative and that you use it to keep up to date, to think critically about how we should move forward, to learn and to share questions and comments. As I've said in the past, I consider this process to be a collaborative effort&mdash;one that is fluid and ever-changing based on the information we have available at any given time. If you have any suggestions or other matters that you think we should address, please reach out through &lsquo;<a href="mailto:EDSC.AvenirduTravail-FutureOfWork.ESDC@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">Ask Tina</a>&rsquo;. I read all of your emails and blog comments and want to thank you for sharing your thoughts, ideas and concerns with me. <a href="/en/department/sadm/tina-namiesniowski/fow-ask-tina-faq.shtml">The Future of Work: Ask Tina Responses</a> is updated on a regular basis with answers to all your important questions, as is the site itself with articles, fun facts, and other tips, tools and information relevant to our research, experimentation and consultation.</p>
<p>Along with the Future of Work Secretariat and all my colleagues working closely with us to chart our way forward, I look forward to hearing from you as we begin to roll out our flexible work model. . . The future is now!</p>

<summary>Meet Stacey from Ontario Region</summary>
<h3>Stacey Goudreau</h3>
<p><strong>Medical Adjudicator<br />Judy LaMarsh Building, Chatham, Ontario</strong></p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4"><img src="/en/department/sadm/tina-namiesniowski/images/stacey-goudreau.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive mrgn-tp-lg mrgn-bttm-lg" height="280" width="280" alt="Stacey Goudreau" />
<p><strong>Working from home since:</strong> August 2020<br /><strong>Return date:</strong> October 2021</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h4>Why did you go into the office?</h4>
<p>Wearing pajamas all day was getting old, and I missed people. My motivation, ability to focus and mood working from home are not the same as when in the office. I also only live a 10-minute drive away.</p>
<h4>How did you feel about going back?</h4>
<p>I was very happy/excited and knew my mental health would be improving.</p>
<h4>How did the first day go?</h4>
<p>Great! I was able to meet my new manager in person.</p>
<h4>What surprised you the most about being back in the office?</h4>
<p>How quiet and empty it was.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h4>How often do you plan to be at the office?</h4>
<p>I work from the office every day.</p>
<h4>What would you like people to know about your experience being back in the office?</h4>
<p>It is nice to see people in person as opposed to through a screen in meetings (that I usually do not turn my camera on for).</p>
<h4>Please share any additional thoughts (optional).</h4>
<p>For National Public Service Week this year, there was pizza provided, and it was nice to have that experience again of celebrating in person. <br />I have met some new people from different areas since being back.</p>

<p><strong>Working from home since:</strong> January 2021<br /><strong>Return date:</strong> November 2021</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h4>Why did you go into the office?</h4>
<p>To have the opportunity to meet new people.</p>
<h4>How did you feel about going back?</h4>
<p>I was nervous, but I&rsquo;m very happy to be back in the office now.</p>
<h4>How did the first day go?</h4>
<p>Lots of issues. My access card didn&rsquo;t work, my computer wasn&rsquo;t compatible with the workspaces, the locker didn&rsquo;t work, the workspace booking system didn&rsquo;t work, which led to someone else reserving the same workspace as me. However, that person ended up really helping me with my reintegration to the office and, over time, became a friend.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h4>What surprised you the most about being back in the office?</h4>
<p>How colourful and nice it is.</p>
<h4>How often do you plan to be at the office?</h4>
<p>Three to four times a week.</p>
<h4>What would you like people to know about your experience being back in the office?</h4>
<p>Going to the office gives you the opportunity to develop new relationships with your colleagues.</p>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>
<details>
<summary>March 28</summary>
<h3>Relaunch of future of work pilot projects</h3>
<p>Testing how to manage hybrid work teams. We will use the results of these projects to make informed decisions about future work arrangements at ESDC.</p>
<h3>Voluntary return to the workplace</h3>
<p>Beginning March 28, ESDC supported the gradual return to the workplace for those employees who made a voluntary choice to come in on an ad hoc or regular basis. These employees need to use the active screening tool, the workplace booking tool and follow all federal public health guidance as well as direction issued at a branch and regional level. Employees, including those who are operationally able to work from home until Labour Day, can expect to be asked by their manager to come to the office periodically to engage in meaningful moments.</p>
</details><details>
<summary>May 31</summary>
<h3>Complete analysis of job functions</h3>
<p>At the end of May, we completed the assessment of job functions to determine where they fit in a flexible work model. This analysis will inform discussions between managers and individual employees that will take place over the summer months.</p>
</details><details>
<summary>June to August</summary>
<h3>Manager/employee discussions</h3>
<p>Managers will engage with their teams on how the flexible work model will apply at an individual and team level, and how teams will implement flexible work arrangements. Later this spring, we will provide managers and employees with tools to guide these important conversations.</p>
</details><details>
<summary>September 6</summary>
<h3>Deadline for confirmation of new flexible work arrangements</h3>
<p>Agreements regarding new flexible work arrangements (as discussed between managers/employees over the summer months) will be in place by this date.</p>
</details><details>
<summary>September 7 and onward</summary>
<h3>ESDC&rsquo;S new flexible workplace</h3>
<p>We begin to put flexible work arrangements in place. Of course, where we start is not where we will finish. This will be an evolving set of work arrangements. We are going to grow, adjust and change as we learn and evaluate what works best under our new flexible work model.</p>

It will set a clear, coherent vision for the Future of Work across the portfolio</li>
<li><strong>Relationship with Enabling Branches</strong>: The Secretariat will not duplicate ongoing work within the department, be it enabling branches, regions, or otherwise. The Secretariat will work with experts in branches in advancing its objectives using a matrix approach</li>
<li><strong>Relationship with Transformation Initiatives</strong>: The Secretariat will be broadly focussing on Future of Work, post-pandemic and beyond. It will work closely with other major transformation initiatives (e.g., BDM) to ensure consistency in approach and communication, while seeking to avoid duplication of efforts</li>
<li><strong>Time Horizon</strong>: Initial span of 18 months, to be extended if required</li>
<li><strong>Functions</strong>: The Secretariat will have the following functions embedded in it:
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis and Integration</strong>: Bring together research relating to the future of work, and create an integrated perspective on where the portfolio currently is, and where it needs to go. Apply a GBA+ lens to initiatives, engage across the department and with OGDs, and manage third party contracts. Develop performance metrics and evaluation strategies to track success of initiatives, including pilots</li>
<li><strong>Change Management</strong>: Working with functional communities, regions and branches, develop change management strategies suited to the individual needs of those sub-organizations. Working with HR, develop training for managers to prepare them for the future of work and how it influences core competencies</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Transformation</strong>: Conduct a cultural assessment of the portfolio, identifying unique aspects of the organization and assessing where efforts are needed to prepare for change, beyond policy and technical changes</li>
<li><strong>Internal Communications and Employee Engagement</strong>: Develop clear communications plan for portfolio as a whole and targeted groups. Conduct surveys and ongoing engagement across the portfolio, as well as with specific groups (e.g., functional, regional) as required. Set-up advisory groups to reflect diverse needs of the portfolio</li>
<li><strong>Secretariat and Program Management</strong>: Develop and track timelines for different initiatives, taking place across the portfolio</li>

<h3 class="mrgn-tp-lg">Consultation on Leadership Norms</h3>
<p>The flexible work environment is a new way of working for most of us. This therefore requires a new way of leading and supporting people. Leadership sets the tone for the organization, and we need to support our leaders in this move to a flexible work environment. We can see this as a challenging time, or we can see it as an opportunity to &ldquo;up our leadership game&rdquo;!</p>
<p>The Future of Work Secretariat recently drafted a Leadership Norms and Behaviours Playbook to support leaders in this new flexible work environment. We consulted with employee, manager and executive networks and received a large number of responses &mdash; thank you! The Playbook, as well as a companion Infographic, are now available for you to read, download, and share:&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Engagement Consultations</h3>
<p class="mrgn-tp-lg">From the end of June through to September, Senior Associate Deputy Minister Tina Namiesniowski and her team held a series of engagements with professional communities and networks (which will continue) within the Department. The purpose was to gather input and feedback from employees on what has worked well during the pandemic and key considerations that should inform our way forward on Future of Work.&nbsp; The Future of Work Secretariat compiled a summary of the input received, which speaks to the benefits, as well as some of the challenges of working from home.</p>
<p>These initial engagement sessions are the first step toward what the Future of Work Secretariat hopes will become an ongoing and growing engagement strategy. &nbsp;Engagement is critical since defining the future by necessity has to involve our employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New engagement summaries will be posted as they become available.&nbsp; In the meantime, if you or your team would like to offer comments, please <a href="#details-panel-engage">share your comments with Tina</a>, or speak to your manager about the possibility of hosting an engagement session.</p>
<h2 id="ymagin">Youth Mandate for Greater Involvement (YMAGIN)</h2>
<p>Tina met with the YMAGIN membership on two dates; an English session on June 29 and a French session on June 30.</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of questions were about the location of work and how decisions will be made regarding a return to the office. Some examples of questions included: Can employees really work from anywhere in Canada? Who will decide when (and for what reason) in-person attendance will be required?</li>
<li>New employees expressed concerns about their career trajectories. Some specific concerns included equitable access to mentorship and other career opportunities, both in the office and remotely.</li>
<li>Members were concerned that flexibility would be taken away from them if they return to the office. Members were also afraid of &ldquo;going back to the way things were.&rdquo; Members felt that they were discouraged from working from home pre-pandemic, and they were uncertain if the corporate culture will encourage flexible work.</li>
<li>Members felt that maintaining accessibility standards at work and at home (such as ergonomic office equipment) should be a priority.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Visible Minority Network</h2>
<p>Tina met with members of the Visible Minority Network in a bilingual session on July 6.</p>
<ul>
<li>The preference is to continue working from home, primarily for the sake of employees&rsquo; physical and mental well-being. There will need to be a consideration of potential issues related to physical and mental health that could emerge or re-emerge following a return to the office.</li>
<li>Working from home has led to a reduction in employee anxiety. This is linked to experiences with racism and microaggressions in the office.</li>
<li>Working remotely has also improved connectivity and engagement within the Visible Minority Network. Increased use of communications technology is encouraged.</li>
<li>We should increase the availability of technical training for all employees, particularly in the regions. We should also improve the quality of the training that is available.</li>
<li>We should focus on processes that will enable more employees to work from home (for example, mailroom employees).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Black Engagement and Advancement Team</h2>
<p>Tina met with members of the Black Engagement and Advancement Team on two dates; an English session on July 7 and a French session on July 14.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many employees benefited from not being in the office, partly due to the absence of racism and microaggressions. New hiring processes where interviewers could not see the candidate have been well received by Black employees.</li>
<li>Technological tools allowed for greater reach for the network to bring together employees from across the country.</li>
<li>The existing corporate culture is seen as a limiting factor on the Department&rsquo;s ability to be proactive in future-of-work policies. This raises questions about why remote work was not considered possible prior to the pandemic.</li>
<li>There are concerns about a lack of career opportunities for Black employees, including those with second-language barriers, as well as gaps in professional mentoring and coaching.</li>
<li>Additional challenges with middle management include:
<ul>
<li>vesting authority in a sole person</li>
<li>requiring manager approval for many things</li>
<li>a perception that initiatives are being blocked</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Training was suggested for management to address an unconscious bias when it comes to the inequitable treatment of remote and in-person employees. Examples include:
<ul>
<li>inconsistent or unfair application of policies surrounding work from home, vacation and other leaves of absence</li>
<li>policies related to Leave with Pay for Other Reasons (699) are applied in a manner perceived be discriminatory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Official Languages Steering Committee</h2>
<p>Tina met with the Official Languages Steering Committee in a bilingual session on July 15.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote work allowed for the creation of geographically distributed teams. The results were both positive and challenging. For example, some areas of the country are largely anglophone, and this creates issues for bilingualism. However, this has also provided an opportunity for employees with some background in French to improve their language skills.</li>
<li>We should leverage current technology to find more efficient ways to do translation in shorter time frames. As an example, simultaneous translation could be helpful for bilingual meetings.</li>
<li>We should source different tools and technologies so that we can manage high workloads at critical times.</li>
<li>We should develop up-to-date second-language curriculums for employees and management.</li>
<li>We should focus on managing the career progressions of lower-level staff (below management), specifically with respect to language requirements. We should hire and promote more bilingual employees.</li>
<li>Strict language requirements have had an impact on recruitment. Language requirements have also had an impact on diversity and inclusion practices, since many members of visible minority communities do not come from French-language backgrounds.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Employee Pride Network</h2>
<p>Tina met with members of the Employee Pride Network in a bilingual session on July 21.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is overall satisfaction with working from home. In some cases, this is due to no longer being a victim of discrimination.</li>
<li>Discrimination has also resulted in low job mobility amongst LGBTQ employees, who may not be able to move jobs in order to get better work flexibility.</li>
<li>Members expect that gender-neutral bathrooms will be available upon any return to the office. There is real disappointment with the progress made in this area, especially in the regions.</li>
<li>There are concerns from employees regarding policies on the return to the office. Who will decide who goes back and on what basis, and what will employees get to decide?</li>
<li>There are additional concerns regarding the safety of open-office types of environments. These concerns include:
<ul>
<li>the cleanliness of shared desks</li>
<li>office conflicts</li>
<li>discrimination against LGBTQ employees in open spaces</li>
<li>ergonomic requirements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Members requested further clarity on how the Department will deal with managers who are averse to allowing more work flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="student">The Student Network</h2>
<p>Tina met with the Student Ambassadors on two dates; an English session on August 10 and a French session on August 12.</p>
<ul>
<li>Representing the views of the student network, the Ambassadors offered that the top concern among students is how to become fully employed in the public service.</li>
<li>There are challenges with regard to on-boarding and engagement in a remote work environment. These challenges include:
<ul>
<li>Students feel excluded due to lack of quick and frequent face-to-face contact.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s difficult for students to integrate themselves into the team.</li>
<li>Students are confused about how to navigate their team and who to reach out to. This has led to negative experiences for some students.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Virtual engagement has worked well. Students were highly involved in online meetings.</li>
<li>Virtual work has opened up many opportunities for students, as they can connect with employees across Canada. We need to provide further opportunities and encourage networking, as students tend to be shy.</li>
<li>The elimination of a commute was beneficial for students (from home to school to work).</li>
<li>There were discussions about better and more effective ways for the Department to communicate with students. The following issues came up:
<ul>
<li>Emails are only accessible to those with network access. This is an issue for students who may not currently be working for the Government of Canada.</li>
<li>We must take care not to focus on a single method of communication.</li>
<li>There are challenges with using social media, especially regarding ethics and judgment.</li>
<li>There has been some success with LinkedIn, as promoted by student ambassadors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Indigenous Employees Circle</h2>
<p>Tina met with the leadership of the Indigenous Employees Circle on August 23.</p>
<ul>
<li>COVID pushed the network to deliver their services nationally and build a social/community space and a sense of community</li>
<li>Adapting to the post-pandemic situation resulted in an increase in work for the IEC leadership</li>
<li>Most requested support was learning opportunities on Mental Health</li>
<li>Much more connected post-pandemic &ndash; better relationships with immediate membership and across Canada
<ul>
<li>Used pandemic to build virtual network over Facebook to stay connected (still being used)</li>
<li>Staged many digital events during pandemic</li>
<li>Regional community building was difficult prior to COVID - video chatting was very difficult to get set up for (getting equipment etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mental Health and Wellness kits were very successful
<ul>
<li>Mental Health kits + traditional medicines, Indigenous awareness workshops (including elders), mental health sessions + monthly Sharing Circles (led by elder), social activities: beading group, Indigenous book club, bingo / trivia games and virtual drop-ins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Various funding issues were highlighted
<ul>
<li>Acquisition card holder relationships/process has been a barrier &ndash; utility/appropriateness of mental health kits was questioned when trying to obtain funding</li>
<li>Issues with budget pre-approval process and access to funding</li>
<li>Access funding to bring in culture/context specific mental health experts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continued and on-going support for Elder sessions
<ul>
<li>Virtual smudging is possible, but there were issues with being able to perform smudging ceremonies in the physical building</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Administrative Professionals Network (APN)</h2>
<p>The Administrative Professionals Network provided their input in the form of written comments to the Secretariat on August 31.</p>
<ul>
<li>For members of the APN, the adoption of technologies like digital signatures and MS Teams enabled remote work, and allowed for effective meetings, communication and engagement. Most employees were fully equipped with the tools for remote work.</li>
<li>The majority of administrative staff across the organization have expressed appreciation for remote work and (post-pandemic) would like to adopt remote/hybrid work options.
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits include</strong>: better work/life balance, lack of commute, less anxiety concerning childcare, improved mental health</li>
<li><strong>Challenges include</strong>: mental health concerns regarding increased workload and lack of in-person interactions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For those working on-site, there is a need to support administrative staff through consistent network access, and up-to-date equipment, both at home and in the office (e.g. Teleconference equipment to support MS Teams).</li>
<li>Processing physical mail is an ongoing challenge across different sites and program areas in our organization, as it requires daily in-office support.</li>
<li>Increased COVID-related site-based responsibilities resulted in increased pressures and workloads for administrative staff who are typically in the office (at least partially).</li>
<li>For those who are required to work on-site how do we ensure fairness when those employees may incur additional costs?</li>
<li>Concerns with the movement of equipment, supplies and personal items between home and the office in the context of unassigned seating.</li>
<li>Need to ensure sufficient time and resources for training when onboarding new administrative employees.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>ESDC Policy Community</h2>
<p>Tina met with the ESDC Policy Community on September 10.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall, policy employees in ESDC enjoy remote working as it allows for a better work-life balance &ndash; especially among those with families</li>
<li>Policy employees are concerned about the establishment of a <strong>forced </strong>hybrid model
<ul>
<li>Do not want work arrangements mandated in a standard way &ndash; want more team and employee autonomy</li>
<li>Employees place a lot of benefit on the flexibility that remote working during the pandemic has allowed in their lives (both personal and work)</li>
<li>Employees want to go in when it&rsquo;s meaningful &ndash; what is the value at being at the office? Why commute to do the same work we could do from home?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Working remotely has made employees more effective in their work
<ul>
<li>Participation in departmental and inter-departmental events has increased</li>
<li>Costs of putting on events have been reduced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Need for change management strategies for processes concerning the sharing of documents in a Hybrid model (e.g. Secret documents, cabinet confidences)</li>
<li>Importance of mental health in the workplace
<ul>
<li>Accommodating telework can support employees&rsquo; mental health</li>
<li>The department should consider a new approach towards team building if we are moving forward with a telework heavy approach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biggest challenge of working from home is loss of connection from people &ndash; small amount of social interaction and being in the same location all day</li>
<li>Concerns surrounding shared work spaces
<ul>
<li>How to ensure employees (especially among those with disabilities) are properly accommodated</li>
<li>Ensure office space layout is optimized for virtual meetings without causing disruption</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Danger of two-tiered employee classification if managers fall back into old habits (presence bias)
<ul>
<li>Return to office will have to be all-digital to avoid this scenario</li>
<li>Consistent support from senior management would assuage fears of sliding backwards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A few instances of entire teams being on-boarded during the pandemic with positive outcomes</li>
</ul>
<h2>ESDC Managers&rsquo; Network</h2>
<p>Tina met with the steering committee of the Mangers Network on September 13.</p>
<ul>
<li>Managers community asked for greater clarity and information about the return to the office (e.g. timelines, policies, logistical and real property considerations)</li>
<li>More information about the mandatory vaccination mandate for public servants was sought &ndash; both overall and more operational clarity (i.e. how will it work)</li>
<li>Managers highlighted the benefits of having access to a greater pool of talent across the country. They expressed interest in having the opportunity to continue this type of arrangement into the future.</li>
<li>Some managers questions reflected a desire for more innovative and efficient tools to help them in their day to day work (e.g. hiring processes, approvals, hybrid meetings)</li>
<li>Managers are interested in knowing how the pandemic will affect the outlook of the public service in terms of workforce size and management practices (e.g. PMAs, horizontal management, position locations and possible relocation impacts)</li>
<li>Some managers expressed disappointment in the delay of the voluntary return to the office and wondered if there is a way to return to the office earlier</li>
<li>Opportunity to use the pandemic to think outside the box and engage in innovative ways to work going forward. Specifically commented about the environmental impact of telework and how we can think of greening our activities even more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Employees with Disabilities Network&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Tina met with the Employees with Disabilities Network on September 22.</p>
<ul>
<li>The network identified problems with the &lsquo;Duty to Accommodate&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;(DTA)&nbsp;policy&nbsp;and&nbsp;process&nbsp;as their primary concern&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Employees with&nbsp;a DTA have been prevented from&nbsp;splitting time&nbsp;between office and home&nbsp;</li>
<li>DTA agreements sometimes don&rsquo;t address the issue (e.g.&nbsp;a quiet office environment)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Can lead to fewer opportunities for advancement&nbsp;</li>
<li>Perception that there is a disregard for the accommodations process and how it has been impacted by the pandemic&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fear of regression to pre-pandemic way of working &ndash; need management to change their approach to how they can support needs of individual employees&nbsp;</li>
<li>Network members mentioned how accommodation and compassion towards individual situations&nbsp;is dependant&nbsp;on perspective of current management.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Importance of organizational culture at&nbsp;&nbsp;lower management levels&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concern with ensuring employees&nbsp;are&nbsp;accommodated&nbsp;both in the office and at home. How will adaptive and ergonomic&nbsp;equipment be provided if an employee must work&nbsp;both&nbsp;in the office and at home?&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Related to concerns about dedicated workspaces&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Following&nbsp;clean desk policies may be more difficult for&nbsp;employees with&nbsp;disabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e.&nbsp;assistance may be needed in&nbsp;cleaning&nbsp;desks)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Largely positive experiences working with MS Teams&nbsp;and other technology&nbsp;&ndash; many employees report finding it easier to connect across geographical spaces&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>However, some issues with using Teams optimally with accessibility features&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Need to make technical support more agile &ndash; have technology adjust to individual needs rather than the other way around&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple concerns about accessibility of current infrastructure (location/physical workspace)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Instances of bathrooms being hard to maneuver for employees with disabilities even after renovations (phase II)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Employees with&nbsp;particular mobility&nbsp;issues may not be able to use doors (phase II)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Issues with&nbsp;GoC&nbsp;building that are leased &ndash; building owners follow provincial accessibility regulations and it is difficult to address the needs of employees with disabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<p>As a large part of our department continues to work together on a virtual basis, we understand that outside distractions also continue to be a part of that reality. Having said that, it is important to create a workspace that is conducive to following proper virtual etiquette for yourself and your fellow team members.</p>
<p>Before joining a video call, make sure you are in a well-lit area and that your camera is positioned properly &mdash; team members should have a clear view of your face, and any gestures you might make to communicate throughout the discussion. Try to keep background noise and activity minimized to avoid distractions for yourself as well as your colleagues.</p>
<p>Having the proper set up for video calls helps to reduce disruptions and allows everyone a fair and equal opportunity to participate and engage in the conversation. While we can only control our remote work environment to a point, it is important to keep these best practices in mind as a guide to following proper virtual etiquette.</p>

<li><strong>Did you know&hellip; the flexible work environment is expected to take a several weeks to get used to &ndash; try to make the most of your first days back in the office so you can quickly get up to speed.</strong>
<ul class="mrgn-bttm-md">
<li>Talk to your manager and identify your priorities during the transition &ndash; employees will need to balance accomplishing their core work with learning the flexible work environment.</li>
<li>If you lead a team of your own, give them time to test things out and permission to fail at their initial attempts.</li>
<li>Explore the office to identify where to find meeting rooms and emergency equipment like fire extinguishers, first aid kits, and emergency exits.</li>
<li>Test available new technology and new processes, such as what&rsquo;s needed to hold hybrid meetings. Try to do this before you need to set up an important one!</li>
<li>Connect and network with colleagues in the office.</li>
</ul>
You can find more information like this in the <a href="/en/department/sadm/tina-namiesniowski/fow-hybrid-teams-playbook.shtml">Managing Hybrid Teams Playbook</a>.</li>
<li class="mrgn-tp-lg"><strong>Did you know&hellip; 56% of employees cited mental health improvements, better work-life balance and more physical activity after taking on a hybrid work environment? Conducted by Ergotron, this study sampled and compared 1000 full-time, in-office workers with hybrid workers.</strong>
<ul class="mrgn-bttm-md">
<li>88% agree that the flexibility to work from home or the office has increased their job satisfaction</li>
<li>75% stated that they are now more empowered to move frequently and have a more active work style when working remotely</li>
<li>Three quarters of respondents say their work-life balance has improved as a result of hybrid or remote working</li>
<li>62% said improved workspaces with comfortable, ergonomic furniture are important and improve company culture</li>
<li>76% revealed that their employers implemented wellness programs to support mental and physical health, with 30% of those being brand new since the COVID-19 pandemic started</li>

<ul class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li>Open the meeting with an Indigenous land acknowledgement</li>

<ul class="lst-none">
<li><strong>Tips to achieve collaboration equity in your hybrid meeting:</strong>
<ul class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li>Ensure the chairperson or meeting facilitator can implement equitable participation</li>
<li>Apply a &ldquo;remote first&rdquo; mindset &ndash; think about those who are not in the meeting room.</li>
<li>Collaborate digitally using raised hands, the chat function, and screen sharing.</li>
<li>Ensure equitable speaking time is allocated to virtual and in-person participants.</li>
<li>Pay attention to mute icons and virtual participants who turn on their camera, as this can indicate a desire to speak.</li>
<li>If a post-meeting conversation takes place among in-person participants, try to document and share anything that is material to the discussion with the virtual participants</li>
</ul>

<ul class="mrgn-bttm-lg">

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Did you know&hellip; Recognizing microaggressions &mdash; and being more aware of our everyday speech &mdash; is fundamental to creating a more inclusive and culturally competent workplace.</strong>
<ul class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li>Microaggressions are everyday subtle put-downs, assumptions, and comments that, regardless of intentions, are hurtful, and damaging.</li>
<li>8% of ESDC employees reported experiencing a microaggression at work, in the past 12 months. Microaggressions were significantly more pronounced among employees belonging to an Employment Equity group (<a href="/en/news/dm/2022/05/05.shtml">Employee Pulse Survey IX</a>).</li>
<li>Online resources like the <a rel="external" href="http://www.themicropedia.org/">The Micropedia of Microaggressions</a>, or <a rel="external" href="https://cediphi.org/les-microagressions-ou-microinegalites/"><span lang="fr">Les microagressions ou microin&eacute;galit&eacute;s &ndash; CEDI&phi; (cediphi.org)</span></a> can help us to have a better understanding of microaggressions, become more aware of own bias, and stereotypes, and learn how we might eliminate them from the workplace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Did you know&hellip; Listening is a key part of empathetic leadership, particularly in a flexible work environment.</strong>
<ul class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li>In a recent study, the firm Zenger Folkman found that leaders who prioritized listening were rated as significantly more effective than those who spent more time talking. Peers, direct reports, and managers rated these leaders as more competent in key areas, from developing others to innovating, collaboration and teamwork.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three tips to becoming a more effective listener:</p>
<ol class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li>If appropriate, identify the feelings being conveyed. Statements such as &ldquo;It sounds like you&rsquo;re worried we might be moving too quickly&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;it seems you&rsquo;re eager to get this moving as quickly as possible&hellip;&rdquo; can both indicate you&rsquo;re listening and probe for confirmation.</li>
<li>Instead of focusing on what you&rsquo;ll say next, listen to what the speaker is saying. Don&rsquo;t let your mind wander or plan the argument you&rsquo;ll make. Really hear their words, and listen for the meaning behind them if this applies.</li>
<li>Be a trampoline, not a sponge. Good listening goes beyond being able to repeat exactly what another person says; it also requires providing a new perspective, adding energy to the conversation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Did you know&hellip; Turning your camera off periodically during the day can reduce feelings of exhaustion.</strong>
<ul class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
<li>After a four-week experiment involving 103 participants and more than 1,400 observations, a study published in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em> found that it is more tiring to have your camera on during a virtual meeting.</li>
<li>Researchers found that fatigue resulted in employees potentially participating less than those not using cameras. This counters the conventional wisdom that cameras are required to be engaged in virtual meetings.</li>
<li>These effects are stronger for women and newer employees who are more vulnerable in terms of their social position in the workplace.</li>

<h2>The Future of Work</h2>
<p>The Future of Work encompasses a wide range of topics, including the workplace, the workforce and the very nature of work itself. These things are changing, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Like Employment and Social Development Canada, many organizations are actively thinking about the Future of Work. Every individual and every organization has their own experience and point of view on the various aspects of this complex issue. As a result, there is a lot of information out there. To help you better understand and navigate these subjects, we&rsquo;ve compiled a list of resources. We&rsquo;ve organized these resources according to ESDC&rsquo;s way of thinking about the future of work, which is framed around four pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realizing our business</li>
<li>Supporting our people and communicating clearly</li>
<li>Rethinking our footprint in the National Capital Region and across Canada</li>
<li>Securing our infrastructure and enabling employees</li>
</ul>
<p>Further links will be added to share information and stimulate our thinking.

<h2>Welcome to the Future of Work Manager&rsquo;s Corner!</h2>
<p>In this section, you will find valuable resources and tools that will help you prepare for, and support your teams through, the transition to a flexible work model. Your role, as people managers, is critically important. We know that employees want to hear about the changes directly from their immediate supervisor. The communication and change management materials will support conversations on the job function analysis and work arrangements. In addition, there are resources and tools to help your team thrive in the new flexible work model.</p>
<section class="alert alert-info">
<p>**Please note that the materials to support team-level conversations are under review and being updated to reflect the guidance from the Treasury Board Secretariat on the Common Hybrid Work Model for the Federal Public Service. We will communicate with <abbr>ESDC</abbr> branches and regions when the updated materials are available.</p>
