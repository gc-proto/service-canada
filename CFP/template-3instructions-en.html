							<h4>B - Budget (Questions 72 to 75 in the PDF version of the application form)</h4>
							<p>This Question is mandatory. Applicants must provide an estimate of the project’s costs.

								<summary><strong>Cost category (Question 72)</strong></summary>
								<p>Applicants shall not request the payment of any charge or fee from participants for their participation in the project.</p>
								<p>If the project will involve subcontracting, a rationale and description of the process to select the subcontractors must be included.</p>
								<p>If applicants intend to contract or subcontract for a value of $25,000 or more, a fair and accountable process that includes the solicitation of a minimum of three bids or proposals is required when contracting for the purchase of project-related goods or services. This includes anyone who is hired to deliver the project who is not an actual employee of the contribution recipient. Failure to comply with ESDC requirements may result in these expenditures being ineligible for reimbursement. In the situation where a contract for goods and services is below the $25,000 threshold, it must still demonstrate the principles of accountability, fairness, and best value for money.</p>
								<p>Refer to the program’s Eligibility criteria on the <a href="#">Who can apply</a> page for expenditures.</p>

								<summary><strong>Planned spending (dollar) (Questions 73 to 75)</strong></summary>
								<p>Give the total planned spending from all sources, including us. The amounts should align with those that you put in section A - Anticipated sources of funding of your application for funding.</p>

							<details>
								<summary><strong>Associated businesses or individuals (Question 76)</strong></summary>
								<p>Check all statements that apply to your planned spending of the funding from us.</p>
								<p>In carrying out the project, you may need contractors or third parties (outside providers) to carry out part of the project activities, such as reporting.</p>
								<p>"Associated businesses or individuals" means:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>an officer, director or employee of your organization, or a member of their immediate family</li>
									<li>a business in which an officer, director or employee of your organization, or a member of their immediate family, has a financial interest</li>
									<li>a business connected to your organization</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Third Party:</strong> a person or organization that has signed an agreement with the organization under the terms and conditions of a master agreement between the organization and the federal government.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary><strong>Capital assets: Will capital assets be among your planned expenditures with ESDC funding? (Question 77)</strong></summary>
								<p>Indicate "Yes" or "No".</p>
								<p>If "Yes", explain how your project will benefit from the purchase of capital assets. A disposal plan for the capital assets should also be included.</p>
								<p>A capital asset is any single or composite asset with a purchase value of more than $1,000 (before taxes) that is not physically incorporated into another product and that remains functional at the end of the project.</p>
								<p>A composite asset is a collection of unique assets that form one identifiable functional unit, where all components are required for the asset to be functional. The collection of assets is treated as a single capital asset if the total cost of all individual items together is greater than $1,000 (before taxes).</p>
								<p>For example, a personal computer composed of a hard drive, a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse and cabling is a composite capital asset. Four $300 chairs are not capital assets because each chair is functional on its own and, as single units, fall below the established threshold of $1,000 (before taxes).</p>
